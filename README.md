AI-Based Emergency Response System with Emotion Detection

Overview

This project is an AI-powered emergency response system designed to enhance user safety through emotion detection. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user emotions from video, audio, or text inputs, triggering an automated emergency response when distress is detected.

Working Process

1. User Interaction:

The user interacts with the Android app, which captures video, audio, or text input.



2. Emotion Detection:

The captured data is processed using a machine learning model to detect emotions.



3. Emergency Trigger:

If distress (such as fear or sadness) is detected, the app:

Sends an alert to pre-configured emergency contacts.

Shares the user's location.

Optionally initiates a voice call or text message for help.




4. Manual Alert:

Users can manually trigger an emergency alert if needed.

Use Cases

Personal Safety: Automatically notifies emergency contacts if a user is in distress.

Mental Health Monitoring: Detects signs of anxiety or depression for timely intervention.

Workplace Safety: Monitors for distress signals in high-risk environments.

Elderly Care: Provides instant help to elderly users if distress is detected.
